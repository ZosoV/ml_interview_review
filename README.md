# Machine Learning Fundamentals Review
In this repository, I intend to review the fundamentals about Machine Learning.
The idea is try to write a brief explanation in Jupyter Notebooks and coding
basic algorithms.

To guide this review, I made a mind map in order to have a bigger picture of
the fundamental topics about Machine Learning. I intend to deal with them in 
this repository.

## Contends

| Notebook | Topics | Extra Material |
|----------|--------|------------|
| [Linear Regresion](001-linear_regresion.ipynb) | Linear Regression, Basic Terminology, Gradient Descent |            |
| [Naive Bayes](005-naive_bayes.ipynb) | Naive Bayes |            |
|          |        |            |

## Notes
This repository and review was based on some courses and video explanations. However, the code was developed by myself.

The followin are the main sources that I used:

* [Coursera: Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
* [DatA414 Course](https://www.kamperh.com/data414/)
* [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/c/joshstarmer)
* Cheat Sheets ML
